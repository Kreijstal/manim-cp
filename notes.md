*GENERAL:*

cluster variant that returns a vgroup

core.Array
A.align_to_index(B,i)
move_as_index(i)  (everything else aligns relative to index)

refactor ABWComponent to use `cursed.sub_scene` and `cursed.cluster`

tf/revert decorator? 
SaveState(x, x.animate...)
Revert(x)

fix combine
fix render

make sub_scene's work out of line in classes
make sub_scene's use Camera

or figure out how to defer everything into
global function `def Correlate():`

add combo to bash script
add checkpointing
add Chkpts to bash

figure out if we should
precompute. I think yes.
this way we can skip around,

Figure out way to capture
state of Scene, pickle/marshal everything to file,
and then load from chkpts
