binary search and ret anim

NARRATION NOTES:
-m end vs. ans
-m implicit dp array
-m on j <= i, no ps. this to avoid confusion

--------------------------------------------
*GENERAL:*

core.Array
A.align_to_index(B,i)

refactor ABWComponent to use `cursed.namespace`

tf/revert decorator? 
SaveState(x, x.animate...)
Revert(x)

fix combine
fix render

make sub_scene's work out of line in classes

or figure out how to defer everything into
global function `def Correlate():`

add combo to bash script
add checkpointing
add Chkpts to bash

figure out if we should
precompute. I think yes.
this way we can skip around,

Figure out way to capture
state of Scene, pickle/marshal everything to file,
and then load from chkpts
