# This channel is dedicated to teaching algorithmic thinking and sharing the joy of computer of science, through problem solving.

Our hope is that you won't need an advanced programming or math background to follow along. We'll consider it a success if  you can come away from each video with a piece of new intuition that, over time, will allow you to experience the feeling of inventing solutions on your own.

Along the way, we'll learn about crucial concepts in math and computer science, but above all the main focus is to have fun with the problems!
