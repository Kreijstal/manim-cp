# This channel is mainly about competitive programming.

If you don't have any idea what that is, it's a sort of, sport that involves participants racing each other to write a series of small programs that each solve some particular problem, under some time or memory constraints. These problems can get really, really hard. But they can also be really, really cool.

# The goal of this channel is to provide a gentle introduction to algorithmic thinking.

My hope is that you won't need an advanced programming or math background to follow along. We'll consider it a success if you can come away from each video with a piece of new intuition that, over time, will allow you to experience the feeling of inventing solutions on your own.

Along the way, we'll learn about crucial concepts in math and computer science, but above all the main focus is to have fun with these puzzles.
